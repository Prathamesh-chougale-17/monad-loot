## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A020F0), drawing inspiration from the Monad chain. Its high saturation adds a playful feel suitable for the app's target user of 'shoppers' and 'gamers'.
- Background color: Dark purple (#1A0333), provides a contrasting backdrop to the primary color while maintaining a consistent hue. The desaturation helps to subdue the background, in a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), placed to the 'left' of the primary on the color wheel. This is for interactive elements to guide the user.
- Clean, modern fonts optimized for readability.
- Use iconography to represent Monad ecosystem projects, badges, and collectible items.
- Clear grid layout with a central focus on the spinning 'Mystery Box' element.
- Implement smooth transitions and engaging animations for opening boxes, revealing rewards, and user interactions.
